<p>Hi, my name is Jeroen Tondeleir and I am currently 17 years old, I’m in 6I at Immaculata Institute.</p>
<p>My first contact with IT was at school, when we needed to work on computers.<br>When I was 6 years old I received my first computer from my parents, it was a pc from Olivetti, and I was very happy with it although I couldn’t do much with it.<br>I was very amazed with the things I could do with it, especially the games opened a new world for me because I couldn’t access internet back then.<br>The games I could play were Minesweeper, 3D pinball and some kind of card game.</p>
<p>Through the years IT got a new meaning for me, I began to discover that a pc could do more than playing games. Since I knew that, my knowledge kept growing and I started working with Microsoft’s products and some other programs. I find IT a very interesting and handy, but dangerous subject.<br>At this moment IT means a lot to me, because it allows me to work more efficiently and faster, it also helps me to get better grades because my handwriting is almost unreadable.<br>I normally spend at least 4 hours a day on my computer.<br>I work on a netbook, it’s very small but easy to take with you.<br>If I think about the things that fascinate me, I would say that I already mentioned it earlier.<br>I’m fascinated with the fact that it opens a new world instead of using books and looking for information, that would probably take ages, you can just look it up. There are a lot of handy tools you can use for free.<br>There is definitely an evolution if I look back how I evolved because of IT, but it’s too much to mention right now.<br>When someone would ask me if I was an expert, I would have to answer that negatively.<br>I say this because I’m definitely not an expert at all, I know more than the average people that don’t follow IT at school, but I still have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>I currently don’t have any future prospects, I only hope that I pass this year and get good grades.<br>My ambitions with IT are rather obvious I think, I want to continue my studies in IT and make it my job.<br>When I think about my aspirations, I just can’t think of any actually.</p>
<p>My life with my pc is quite intertwined, I am using it too much and not only to work for school, I used it too much to relax myself: like movies, browsing YouTube etc.<br>IT has become a huge factor in my life because it will probably be my job later, it also is one of my biggest interests.</p>
